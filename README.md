</ul>
	
Version 5:<ul>
	<li>Added Adapter Name update to Main page.
	<li>Added Truck Make, Model, Serial No, and Unit No to Next Pages.
	<li>Added App Settings class for BlueFire settings.

	<li>Added SendPGN method and PGNData property for sending non-API defined PGNs.
	<li>Added sample code for SendPGN and MonitorPGN.
	<li>Added commons-codec-1.10.jar to the project libs folder. This is only required for the API Demo app.
	<li>Added a projects docs folder that contains the commons javadoc files. You must set the Javadoc Location project property to point to this folder.
</ul>
	
Version 7:<ul>
	<li>GetVehicleData is now threaded for performance.
	<li>Compatible with Adapter Firmware 3.x.
</ul>
	
Version 8:<ul>
	<li>Fixed retrieving J1939 Component Id (Make, Model, Serial No, Unit No).
	<li>Added retrieving J1587 VIN, Component Id and Faults.
	<li>Added additional exception handling.
</ul>
	
Version 9:<ul>
	<li>Added additional exception handling.
	<li>Added additional debug logging to the Demo app (Main).
</ul>
	
Version 10:<ul>
	<li>Added J1587 filtering.
	<li>Truck numerical data is initialized to -1.
	<li>Demo App (Main) shows NA if truck data is negative (no data).
</ul>
	
Version 11:<ul>
	<li>Renamed FWVersion property to FirmwareVersion.
	<li>Renamed HWVersion property to HardwareVersion.
	<li>J1587 filtering caters for a 0 value where appropriate.
</ul>

	<li>Changed SetDiscoveryTimeOut default to 30 seconds.
</ul>
	
Version 15:<ul>
	<li>Supports Adapter Firmware 3.7.
	<li>GetVehicleData, GetFuelData, and GetEngineHours retrieves data more accurately (firmware 3.6 and lower work, but better performance with firmware 3.7). 
</ul>
	
Limitations:<ul>
	<li>VIN and Component Id will be retrieved only from the Engine ECU.
	<li>Only Engine Active faults are retrieved.
	<li>Only J1939 or J1587 faults can be retrieved (not J1939 and J1587 faults).
	<li>Not compatible with new 500K CAN adapter (green Deutsch connector).
